## What does this repository contain?

This repository contains the data and code needed to reproduce the results reported in the chapter.

## How to use this repository?

The analyses were performed in a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/), an interactive programming environment that runs in a web browser.

If you have not used Python before on your computer, install a suitable package manager to manage Python and its associated libraries. For macOS, we recommend [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation). In case you run Windows, use [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/). 

To install Jupyter on **macOS**, follow the instructions below:

  1. Open the Terminal application 
  
  2. Create a Python 3 virtual environment named `logocorp` by entering the following command: `python3 -m venv ~/logocorp`
  
  3. Clone this repository from GitHub by entering the following command: `git clone https://github.com/thiippal/logo-corpus.git`. This clones the repository into a directory named `logo-corpus`. Use the command `cd logo-corpus` to change into the directory.
  
  4. Install the required libraries by entering the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  
  5. Open the Jupyter notebook by entering the following command: `jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb`
  
  6. Select the *Cell* menu and *Run all* to execute the notebook.
